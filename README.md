# E-dictionary

there are three acticities: activity_main, activity_detail, acticity_update;

the corresponding .java files are: MainActvity, DetailActivity and UpdateActivity.
    
the figure.xml is serves as a layout file for the RecyclerView in activity_main;

the detail.cml is serves as a layout file for the ListView in activity_detail;

these are the basic structures for our homework, which will be updated in the following days.

if there is any problem please contact me.
